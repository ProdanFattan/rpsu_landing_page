        <p className="pt-4 pb-8">
          RPSU is committed to foster an open and supportive culture that
          promotes learning, teaching, research, and discovery.  This commitment
          includes ensuring a shielded ambience for the learners, teachers,
          employers and employees free of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
          has a cumulative, demoralizing effect that discourages women from
          asserting themselves within the workplace or institution while among
          men it reinforces stereotypes of women as vulnerable sex objects.
          Severe or pervasive sexual harassment creates a hostile or
          intimidating environment that causes women to leave their jobs or
          education.
          <br />
          Unethical code of conducts like Sexual harassment strikes the
          moralaxioms of RPSU. RPSU team is relentlessly functioning to curb
          such type of fallacious practice. Therefore, this policy aims at
          protecting every individual at RPSU irrespective of age, sex, marital
          status, education or profession, religion, caste, sexual orientation
          and ethnic group. The motto is to ensure justice to the victim
          irrespective of any of the aforementioned variables.
          <br />
          Therefore RPSU has adopted a policy regarding sexual harassment in
          workplace/educational institution accordance with the very specific
          guideline provided by a judgment of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh
          dated 14.05.2009 in the case of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers
          Association (BNWLA) VS. Bangladesh and Others, 14 BLC (2009) 694.
